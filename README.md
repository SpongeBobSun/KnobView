# KnobView
Knob widget for Android developers.

This project is forked from my project "mPod".

KnobView will provide a knob widget for android developers.
Usually we can find this "knob" thing on some sound system consoles.
This is useful for APPs like music tweak tool or DJ scratch console.
Actually I use this widget in mPod as a "wheel control" like the one on Apple's iPods.
I add a Apache license to this project.
But my original thought was "Do What The Fuck You Want To" license.
You can use this widget in any ways you like. Commercial, non-conmmercial, I really don't give a ****.
